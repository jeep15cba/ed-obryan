		"It is generally expected that orthopaedic surgeons, from all corners of the world, undergo further subspecialist training after completing their studies. The various training centres Edward has learnt from are on a globe below.",
		"While it is important to get international perspectives and stay up-to-date with modern techniques from around the globe, we are privileged in Australia to have what is consistently ranked as the highest level healthcare in the world. Our health outcomes eclipse those of the USA, UK, greater Eurasia and elsewhere. Our local surgical training program is envied both within Australia as well as abroad. You are likely to receive world-standard orthopaedic care from any surgeon trained in Melbourne, and for this our community is proud.",
		"Upon completing his training, Edward was humbled to be invited by those he trusted most, his mentors Mr Chris Jones and Mr Sam Joseph, to the Bayside Hip & Knee Fellowship in Melbourne. This was a year-long fellowship in public and private practice around the bayside area, focusing on hip and knee surgery. Edward was fortunate to train in two different muscle-sparing hip approaches; the direct anterior and direct superior approach, and gain familiarity with four different robotic systems for the hip and knee. He also gained insights into sport knee injury management.",
		"He has since completed a European travelling fellowship, focused on all aspects of his practice with highly published world experts in various subspecialist areas."
